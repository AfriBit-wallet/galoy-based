## Goal

This repository is the AfriBit mobile application. The goal is to make a mobile application compatible with Galoy's backend that is tailored to the specific region of Kibera, Kenya. It is built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), and runs on both iOS and Android.

## Start

Prerequisite -- [Set up React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) by following the instructions in the **React Native CLI Quickstart** tab

Clone into the project

cd into the directory

type `yarn install`

type `yarn start`

In another window
type `yarn ios` or `yarn android` to run locally.

The app is built and pushed to the App Store and Play Store on demand with CircleCI.

To run the app fully locally the backend must also be set up by following the instructions at https://github.com/GaloyMoney/galoy.
